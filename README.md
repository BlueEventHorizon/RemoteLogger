# RemoteLogger

**RemoteLogger is the logging tool for output log to the another device through local network**

It means you can see your app's log on a real iPhone/iPad device by another one at anywhere if they are in the same local network.

## Restriction

RemoteLogger works only after iOS13 since it uses Network Framework.

The network core modules come from [Apple's example](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/building_a_custom_peer-to-peer_protocol). So if you use this code, you must comply with the [license](./LICENSE.txt)
